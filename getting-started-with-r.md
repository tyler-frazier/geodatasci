# Getting Started with RStudio & R

## Starting RStudio

Once you have finished the installation process, run the RStudio IDE, which will automatically find R on your computer.  Find the application RStudio on your computer.  The RStudio executable should be located in the applications folder on a Mac.  Once running the RStudio application on a Mac it is often helpful to keep the application icon in the dock, which is the bar of applications that exists along the bottom of your computer desktop screen.  On Windows, if you select the Window icon in the bottom left corner and begin typing RStudio, you should see the application icon appear. On a Linux system, the application should appear in one of the OS drop down windows.  Choose the application icon and open it.

If both R and RStudio were properly installed, then the start up for RStudio should appear something like the following image.
