# Getting Started with RStudio & R

## Starting RStudio

Once you have finished the installation process, run the RStudio IDE, which will automatically find R on your computer.  Find the application RStudio on your computer.  The RStudio executable should be located in the applications folder on a Mac.  Once running the RStudio application on a Mac it is often helpful to keep the application icon in the dock, which is the bar of applications that exists along the bottom of your computer desktop screen.  On Windows, if you select the Window icon in the bottom left corner and begin typing RStudio, you should see the application icon appear. On a Linux system, the application should appear in one of the OS drop down windows.  Choose the application icon and open it.

If both R and RStudio were properly installed, then the start up for RStudio should appear something like the following image.

One of the first things to note at start up is the bottom left hand pane, which is essentially a window to the R interpreter.  RStudio reports the version of R that has been installed on your computer.  Next go to the pull down menu for **File &gt; New Script &gt; R Script** and select that option.  This will create a new R Script that will appear in the top left pane of your R Studio IDE.  One can think of the script as the location where all computer code will be written and saved, in a manner somewhat analogous to writing a letter or essay with a work processor.  Below the script in RStudio is the console or the location where your commands are sent and responses from R will be returned.  You can think of the **&gt;** symbol in the console as R somewhat figuratively waiting for your command and subsequently also the location where R will respond.
