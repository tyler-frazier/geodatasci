# Rendering Topography

In this last project, you will revist the de facto urban areas you defined as well as the transportation infrastructure and health care facilites you spatially located.  Using your combined adm2 or adm3, you will intersect those land use, transport and health care geographies with the topography of your selected adm2 or adm3.  You may recall that we used the `rayshader::` package back in project 1, which we will use again, but this time will focus on its application with rasters rather than starting with a `sf` object.
