# An Introduction to R from a Spatial Perspective

## What is R and how to install it

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics that compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.  It is a very capable programming environment for offering a good introduction to data science methods.  R is also extensible for executing some of the most poweful, advanced, and state of the art statistical and machine language functions within the context of a wide variety of disciplines and applications.  Using R is capable of working with big data, high dimension data, spatial data, temporal data, as well as data at pretty much any imaginable scale available, from the to the quark and everywhere in between.

Before installing R on your operating system, it is a good idea to briefly assess the state of your computer and its constituent hardware as well as the state of your operating system.  Prior to installing a new software environment, such as R, I always recommend the following.

1. Do your best to equip your personal computer with the latest release of your operating system
2. Make sure you have installed all essential updates for your operating system
3. Restart your computer
4. Make sure that all non essential processes have not automatically opened at login, such as e-mail, messaging systems, internet browsers or any other software

After you have updated your computer and done your best to preserve all computational power for the installation process, go the **R Project for Statistical Computing** website.

Find the **download** link and click on it.  If this is the first time you have downloaded **R**, then it is likely that you will also need to select a CRAN mirror, from which you will download your file.  Choose one of the mirrors from within the USA, preferable a server that is relatively close to your current location.  I typically select, Duke, Carnegie Mellon or Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   A more comprehensive install of R on a Mac OS X will include the following steps.

1. Click on the `R.pkg`  file to download the latest release.  Following the steps and install **R** on your computer.
2. Click on the **XQuartz** link and download the latest release of `XQuartz.dmg` .  It is recommended to update your XQuartz system each time you install or update **R**.
3. Click on the **tools** link and download the latest `clang.pkg` and `gfortran.pkg`. Install both.
