# Extracting Populations from a Raster and Aggregating to each Unit

Now that you have selected your LMIC and produced a basic geospatial description of that country at both the adm1 and adm2 levels of government, you are now set to join some data to each of those units and begin conducting a basic descriptive analysis.  Start by going back to the HDX website and search for the available datasets associated with your selected country.  Look for a dataset with the name of your country followed by the term population.  For Liberia the link is named **Liberia - Population**.  After you find the link, follow it where you should find a page that lists the names of several `.tif` files under the **Data and Resources** tab.  Since it is the year 2019, go ahead and download the file for this year.  For Liberia the file is named **lbr\_ppp\_2019.tif**.

Clicking on the download tab may automatically begin the process of downloading the `.tif` file into your downloads folder.  Sometimes your web browser may be set to try and display the image file directly within the browser itself.  You should still be able to save the file directly to your downloads folder, OR go back to the download tab, right click on it, and select **download linked file**, in order to override any attempt to display the image.

After you have succesfully downloaded the file, go to your project folder that you previously used as your working directory and create a new folder within the `/data` folder that will be dedicated to raw data from worldpop.
