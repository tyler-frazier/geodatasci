# Extracting Populations from a Raster and Aggregating to each Unit

Now that you have selected your LMIC and produced a basic geospatial description of that country at both the adm1 and adm2 levels of government, you are now set to join some data to each of those units and begin conducting a basic descriptive analysis.  Start by going back to the HDX website and search for the available datasets associated with your selected country.  Look for a dataset with the name of your country followed by the term population.  For Liberia the link is named **Liberia - Population**.  After you find the link, follow it where you should find a page that lists the names of several .tif files under the **Data and Resources** tab.  Since it is the year 2019, go ahead and download the file for this year.  For Liberia the file is named **lbr\_ppp\_2019.tif**.
