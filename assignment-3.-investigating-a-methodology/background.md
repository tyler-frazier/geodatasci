# Background

“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.  Just as the microscope transformed biology by exposing germs, and the electron microscope changed physics, all these data are turning the social sciences upside down.  Researchers are now able to understand human behaviour at the population level rather than the individual level."  Sinan Aral \(cited in [Cukier, 2010](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2010/02/27/data-data-everywhere)\)

Read Chris Anderson – The End of Theory: The Data Deluge makes the Scientific Method Obsolete.  Consider his argument that massively abundant data has replaced the need for models and his idea that this massive corpus can be treated as a laboratory for the human condition.  Anderson's supposition requires us to detach the tether of data as something that can be visualized in its totality and cosndier a world where massive amounts of data and applied mathematics replace every other tool.  He argues that the prevalence and growth of big data has generally advanced the assumption that sampling design, methodology and validation becomes increasingly unnecessary as sample size presumes to approach population size.  What do you think?  Is theory really dead?
