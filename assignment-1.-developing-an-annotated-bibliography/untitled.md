# Background

**Human development** has been defined as the process of enlarging human choices. Every day we make different types of choices. Some choices are economic, while others may be motivated by cultural factors. In order to enlarge the choices people have throughout every aspect of their lives, capabilities need to be enhanced, while opportunities to use those capabilities need to be improved.

A mismatch between capabilities and opportunities can lead to human frustration and the loss of human potential. Balance between the two helps to maximize human development. For too long the paradigm of economic growth has dominated the idea of human development as the end of development. Income is critical but it is not an end. It is about expanding the richness of life, rather than simply the richness of the economy in which human beings live. It is an approach that is focused on people and their opportunities and choices. To use a similar phrase, one might say that human development is development of the people \(capital\), for the people \(translated to the lives of people\) and by the people \(people are not only receiving but active participants in the process.

After considering the above description of human development, listen to Selim Jahan's podcast's.
