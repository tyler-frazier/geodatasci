# Background

**Human development** has been defined as the process of enlarging human choices. Every day we make different types of choices. Some choices are economic, while others may be motivated by cultural factors. In order to enlarge the choices people have throughout every aspect of their lives, capabilities need to be enhanced, while opportunities to use those capabilities need to be improved.

A mismatch between capabilities and opportunities can lead to human frustration and the loss of human potential. Balance between the two helps to maximize human development. For too long the paradigm of economic growth has dominated the idea of human development as the end of development. Income is critical but it is not an end. It is about expanding the richness of life, rather than simply the richness of the economy in which human beings live. It is an approach that is focused on people and their opportunities and choices. To use a similar phrase, one might say that human development is development of the people \(capital\), for the people \(translated to the lives of people\) and by the people \(people are not only receiving but active participants in the process.

After considering the above description of human development, listen to the following two podcast's by Selim Jahan, Director of UNDP's Human Development Report Office.

Human develoment can also focus on the state of development in a country as well as that process over time.  Hans Rosling noted that many of the preconceived ideas about global development & global health are erroneous.  Listen to the following TEDx talk by Rosling and consider his observations on the following.

* The western world being understood as having long life in small family, while the third world, a shorter life in a larger family
* The tremendous social change that occurred in Asia before economic change and how health appeared to be a precursor to wealth
* The relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita, is there a gap when disaggregated from continents to countries to quintiles?
