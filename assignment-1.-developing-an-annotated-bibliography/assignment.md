# Assignment

## Summary

In this assignment you will begin your exploratory investigation into a geospatial human develop- ment process. You will select four articles from a series of publications that use geospatial data to answer a scientific question about human development. Then you will annotate each of your selected articles by answering a series of questions about the intersection of each source with the main themes of this course. Finally, you will propose a research topic and select a region or country for continuing your exploratory investigation into a dimension of human development.

## Instructions

The purpose of the annotated bibliography is to begin establishing a boundary for your research while describing and defining the landscape of knowledge that populates your selected area of investigation. The annotated bibliography is a starting point for describing the problem you will investigate in terms of harms, significance, and inherency, as well as a means for clarifying the parameters of your inquiry.

Review the publications pages on the flowminder and worldpop websites. From the 100 publications on flowminder and the more than 100 publications in the methods and application sections on worldpop, select four that seem interesting to you.

After selecting your four articles, annotate each one, by identifying and describing the most significant harms in each article as well as the inherent and complex nature of the problem. Try to describe the global nature of the dimension of human development as it relates to each article. Additionally, consider the following questions.

How does this article relate to Amartya Sen’s definition of Human Development?

Which dimension of human development is being addressed by the authors’ research?

Which sustainable development goals can be considered in relation to your selected article

Which \(geospatial\) datasets are used by the authors?

Which \(geospatial\) data science methods are used by the authors?

Which human development pattern or process are the authors investigating?

Which scientific question are the authors seeking to answer?

After you have finished annotating each article, synthesize your results into a one or two paragraph summary. Follow your summary by proposing a research topic you would like to continue investigating this semester. Select a topic that includes the use of data science methods and applications to describe, analyze, model and/or simulate a geospatial human development pattern, process or phenomenon. Your selected research topic will be the beginning point for your exploratory investigation into how data science is advancing scientific inquiry into the dimensions of human development. Following are a few suggested examples.

Disaster Response

Socioeconomic Analysis

Precision Epidemiology

Informal settlements, migration and urbanization

Infrastructure and social service accessibility

Resource management and food security

Propose focusing on one of the Sustainable Development Goals

After selecting a research topic, propose a region or country that you think will be interesting for further investigation and begin to describe the local nature and complex challenges associated with your selected human development problem within the context of that location.

Deliverable

Use LATEX to typeset your annotated bibliography. Your annotated bibliography should be at least 1600 words in length and include a minimum of 4 different sources. Title your annotated bibliography and be sure to include your name. I will not include the title or reference information when verifying your work has met the word count. Please upload your finished PDF document to blackboard prior to the deadline, Saturday, February 9th no later than 10:00 PM.
