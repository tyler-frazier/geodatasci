# Background

**Human development** has been defined as the process of enlarging human choices. Every day we make different types of choices. Some choices are economic, while others may be motivated by cultural factors. In order to enlarge the choices people have throughout every aspect of their lives, capabilities need to be enhanced, while opportunities to use those capabilities need to be improved.

A mismatch between capabilities and opportunities can lead to human frustration and the loss of human potential. Balance between the two helps to maximize human development. For too long the paradigm of economic growth has dominated the idea of human development as the end of development. Income is critical but it is not an end. It is about expanding the richness of life, rather than simply the richness of the economy in which human beings live. It is an approach that is focused on people and their opportunities and choices. To use a similar phrase, one might say that human development is development of the people \(capital\), for the people \(translated to the lives of people\) and by the people \(people are not only receiving but active participants in the process.

After considering the above description of human development, listen to the following two podcast's by Selim Jahan, Director of UNDP's Human Development Report Office.

Human develoment can also focus on the state of development in a country as well as that process over time.  Hans Rosling noted that many of the preconceived ideas about global development & global health are erroneous.  Listen to the following TEDx talk by Rosling and consider his observations on the following.

* The western world being understood as having long life in small family, while the third world, a shorter life in a larger family
* The tremendous social change that occurred in Asia before economic change and how health appeared to be a precursor to wealth
* The relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita, is there a gap when disaggregated from continents to countries to quintiles?

Also read the first three chapters from Amartya Sen's Development as Freedom and consider a number of the themes he introduces as part of his highly significant work.

* Introduction: Development as Freedom
  * Development is the process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy
  * If freedom is what development advances then there is a major argument for con- centrating on that objective rather than on some particular means or chosen list of instruments
  * Development requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom
  * Despite vast wealth, the contemporary world denies elementary freedom to vast num- bers, perhaps the majority of the world population
  * Freedom is central to the process of development
  * Free and sustainable agency emerges as a major engine of development. It is a constituent part and also contributes to the strengthening of free agencies of other kinds
* Chapter 1: The Perspective of Freedom
  * Maitreyee’s question “Can I achieve immortality through wealth?” No “What should I do with that by which I do not become immortal”
  * forms of unfreedom
  * freedom involves both processes that allow freedom of actions and decisions and the actual opportunities that people have given their personal and social circumstances
  * Two roles of freedom or expansion of the “capabilities” of persons to lead the kind of lives they value and have reason to value
  * evaluative systems
  * positive effects of the market system
  * replacement of bonded labor \(such as traditional agricultural\) and forced work with a system of free contract labor
  * Individual freedom is a social product
* Chapter 2: The Ends and the Means of Development
  * Comparison of development as a “fierce” process and a world in which wisdom de- mands toughness and calculated neglect of various concerns that are seen as “soft- headed”
  * contrasts alternative outlook that sees development as a “friendly process”, based on mutually beneficial exchanges, the working of social safety nets, political liberties or social development
  * development is the process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy
  * *
