To begin with, watch _An African Election_, a movie about the 2008 Presidential Election between Professor John Atta Mills from the National Democratic Party \(NDC\) and Nana Akufo-Addo from the National Patriotic Party \(NPP\).  Consider some of the human development themes from the movie, especially the film's focus on demoncracy, capitalism, poverty and their pervasive relationship to human development .

> “Democracy is only as strong or weak as the participants in the process choose to make it.”  Hannah Tetteh, NDC spokesman

> “If every four years you go to the polling station and you put a piece of paper in a ballot box, and you are not generating sufficient wealth, and you’re not distributing the wealth that is generated equitably, and people still suffer poverty, ignorance and disease, then democracy is absolutely meaningless.”  Kwesi Pratt, Radio Host

What is the role of democracy in a developing country and is there a link between poverty and political stability?  Does An African Election provide any insight as to how Ghana’s democracy is supporting or detracting from their development?  What is your response to the relationship of **democracy** to human development and its impact on your selected area of investigation?  Is there a connection?

> “The distribution of the cake should be fair around the world.”  A Ghanian Miner noting he does the same job as an American miner but gets paid much less
>
> “It is the savagery of capitalism.”  J.J. Rawlings referencing Pope John Paul and the effects of globalization on developing West Africa

Also consider the relationship between economic prosperity, poverty and human development.  What role does capitalism have in promoting human development?  Do you think Ghana is evidencing the "fierce" or "friendly" process as described by Amartya Sen?  Do you think there is a global connection that links economic justice to democratic ideals?  What is your response to the relationship of **capitalism** to human development its impact on your selected area of investigation?  Is there a connection?

Once you have finished watching _An African Election_, next listen to the May 2012, Kapuściński Lecture by Owen Barder from the Center for Global Development.

There are a number of different themes presented through the course of Barder's lecture, but most central is the concept of complexity.

> Development should not be thought of as the sum of improvements in the well being of people or the output of firms where it can be catalyzed by providing some missing ingrediant.  Instead human development should be understood as an emergent property from a complex and adpating economic and social system that is comprising of interacting, simulataneoulsy co-evolving agents...And his \(Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen\) insight, which is, really, at the heart of all this stuff, is that economic systems are not like evolutionary systems, they are evolutionary systems.  Owen Barder
