To begin with, watch _An African Election_, a movie about the 2008 Presidential Election between Professor John Atta Mills from the National Democratic Party \(NDC\) and Nana Akufo-Addo from the National Patriotic Party \(NPP\).  Consider some of the human development themes from the movie, especially the film's focus on demoncracy, capitalism, poverty and their pervasive relationship to human development .

> “Democracy is only as strong or weak as the participants in the process choose to make it.”  Hannah Tetteh, NDC spokesman

> “If every four years you go to the polling station and you put a piece of paper in a ballot box, and you are not generating sufficient wealth, and you’re not distributing the wealth that is generated equitably, and people still suffer poverty, ignorance and disease, then democracy is absolutely meaningless.”  Kwesi Pratt, Radio Host

What is the role of democracy in a developing country and is there a link between poverty and political stability?  Does An African Election provide any insight as to how Ghana’s democracy is supporting or detracting from their development?  What is your response to the relationship of **democracy** to human development and its impact on your selected area of investigation?  Is there a connection?

> “The distribution of the cake should be fair around the world.”  A Ghanian Miner noting he does the same job as an American miner but gets paid much less
>
> “It is the savagery of capitalism.”  J.J. Rawlings referencing Pope John Paul and the effects of globalization on developing West Africa

Also consider the relationship between economic prosperity, poverty and human development.  What role does capitalism have in promoting human development?  Do you think Ghana is evidencing the "fierce" or "friendly" process as described by Amartya Sen?  Do you think there is a global connection that links economic justice to democratic ideals?  What is your response to the relationship of **capitalism** to human development its impact on your selected area of investigation?  Is there a connection?

Once you have finished watching _An African Election_, next listen to the May 2012, Kapuściński Lecture by Owen Barder from the Center for Global Development.  While listening to the lecture, also open the slides Barder has provided to accompany his talk by accessing the link after the soundcloud audio file.

There are a number of different themes presented through the course of Barder's lecture, but most central is the concept of complexity.

> Development should not be thought of as the sum of improvements in the well being of people or the output of firms where it can be catalyzed by providing some missing ingrediant.  Instead human development should be understood as an emergent property from a complex and adpating economic and social system that is comprising of interacting, simulataneoulsy co-evolving agents...And his \(Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen\) insight, which is, really, at the heart of all this stuff, is that economic systems are not like evolutionary systems, they are evolutionary systems.  Owen Barder

Just as Sen introduced us to the idea that human development should encompass more than  the paradigm of economic growth.  Rather human development should include the ability to “enlarge people's choices, capabilities and freedoms, so that they can live a long and healthy life, have access to knowledge, a decent standard of living, and participate in the life of their community.”  Likewise, Barder is expanding our definition of economic systems by classifying them as evolutionary systems.

How can your area of investigation into a dimension of human development be described as a complex system?  Does your area of investigation exhibit any of the following properties?

* It's difficult or impossible to predict in detail
* Can make broad predictions about the system as a whole
* Has emergent properties
* Tends towards greater complexity
* The system does not tend towards equilibrium

What are the implications of Barder's talk; are his final recommendations relevant to your investigation?  

How can developing a better understanding of economic and social systems as complex, evolutionary systems help us to better understand human development? What role does data science play in advancing this better understanding?
