# Final Project

For the final project in this course you will create a Git-hub pages site using a fairly simple programming language called markdown and populate that site with content you have created through the course of this semester.  Upon completing your github pages site, you will post a link to your website on the slack channel \#data100\_final.

To begin go to the git-hub webpage and create a new account.  Git-hub is found at the web address[ ](https://github.com)[https://github.com](https://github.com).  Sign up for a new account.

After clicking on the sign up link, create your account by designating your usename, e-mail address and password.  In order to simulate the process of signing up, I am using the username `wicked-problems.`  My real git-hub account is [https://github.com/tyler-frazier](https://github.com/tyler-frazier), please feel free to follow me.

After creating your account, you should receive an e-mail asking to verify your account.  Go ahead and verify, so Github can permit you to create a new repository.  Once you you verify your e-mail address, git-hub will likely ask you if you want to create a new repository.  If you somehow landed on the profile page for your account then can also create a new repository be selecting the + pull down arrow in the top right corner of the page.

You will also notice that there is a guide made available for new users \(the green, read the guide tab\).  This is really good guide to read, in order to learn how to use git-hub as a version control system.  Although you won't be using most of the functionality provided by git-hub for this final project, I highly recommend making a mental note of the guide and returning to the 10 minute read when you have some time.  If you are planning to major or minor in Data Science, Computer Science, or pretty much any discipline that has a signficiant compuational component, it will be very likely that at some point in the future you will need to use a version control system such as git-hub for repository control, sharing, collaboration, conflict resolution etc...[https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Now, go ahead and create your first repository.  I will name my repository `final_project`.

After creating your repository, go to the main page for your repository.  You should see a quick setup script under the `code` tab.  Click on `create a new file` under the quick set-up at the top of the page.

This should bring you to a new page where you are able to create a new file.  Enter a name for your new file, which should be called `README.md` in order for it to be properly found by git-hub pages.  Then add a `header` and one line describing the content of this file. You will use markdown as your scripting language for producing your final project.  It is a relatively simple language than enables for producing webpages fairly easily.  For example to create the first level header in your markdown file, simple type `#` followed by the header text.

You can also preview the output from your markdown file, by clicking on the preview changes tab.

After typing the simple markdown script, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the green commit button, to commit your file to your repository.

To begin getting an understanding of how to use markdown, refer to the following cheatsheet.

For the final project, you will only be using headers, paragraph text and inserting images and possibly videos to your git-hub pages site.  After having a look at the markdown cheatsheet, return to the main page of your repository, which should look like the following.  After navigating to that location, click on the `settings` tab in the top right hand corner.

Scroll down to the GitHub pages section under settings and change the page source from `none` to `master_branch`.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-12-08-at-10.24.15-pm.png)

After setting the branch where your git-hub pages files will reside, also select the theme tab and choose one of the available themes.  I chose the theme `Caymen` for my page, but you are welcome to select any of the available themes for your final project.  After, selecting your theme and returning to the git-hub pages section, you should notice a web address appear where your site has been published.  It might take a moment or two for your webpage to appear, but it should readily accessible.

After clicking on the link, you should appear at your newly created webpage that you will use to publish the results from your investigation.
