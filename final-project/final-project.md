# Final Project

For the final project in this course you will create a Git-hub pages site using a fairly simple programming language called markdown and populate that site with content you have created through the course of this semester.  Upon completing your github pages site, you will post a link to your website on the slack channel \#data100\_final.

To begin go to the git-hub webpage and create a new account.  Git-hub is found at the web address[ ](https://github.com)[https://github.com](https://github.com).  Sign up for a new account.

After clicking on the sign up link, create your account by designating your usename, e-mail address and password.  In order to simulate the process of signing up, I am using the username `wicked-problems.`  My real git-hub account is [https://github.com/tyler-frazier](https://github.com/tyler-frazier), please feel free to follow me.
