# Investigating Land Use and Land Cover Data

For the next lab you will use land use and land cover data to describe and analyze your LMIC as well as to model relationships between different large area, geospatial attributes.  To start, create a new folder within your project `data` folder.  This will be the location where you will store a number of different raster files, or geospatial coveriates, that you will use to begin describing and analyzing your LMIC.  I have called my subfolder `lulc` which stands for land use and land cover.

Once you have created your `lulc` folder within your `data` folder, open google and search for the 3 digit ISO code for your seleted low or middle income country.
