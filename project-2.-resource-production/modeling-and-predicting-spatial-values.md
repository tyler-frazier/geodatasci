# Modeling & Predicting Spatial Values

In this lab, you will use the model estimates in order to predict spatial values across the landscape of your selected LMIC.  To do this create a new script, install and load needed packages and libraries, and set your working directory.  Once you have your script set up to go with `sf::` , `raster::`, `tidyverse::`, `doParallel::`, and `snow::` all in place, again load your `RasterStack` into your RStudio workspace.  I named my 12 layer `RasterStack` that describes land use and land cover throughout Liberia `lulc`, which has the following summary.
