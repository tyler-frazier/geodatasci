To begin, watch _City of God_, a movie about Rio de Janiero and the transformation of a public housing project into a favela over the course of three decades.  When watching the movie, consider the following statements and observations from the movie.

> Se correr o bicho pega, se ficar o bicho come.
>
> Run and the beast catches you, stay and the beast eats you.

What is your interpretation of how the City of God and its transformation influenced its inhabitants' fate?  How did each of the main characters evolve throughout the movie? What was each characters' ultimate fate?  How did the favela and its social groups grow, transform and change during each of the three time periods?  What were some of the important institutions that had significant agents operating in the City of God? Additionally, what were some of the most important human development themes you observed during the movie? Please feel free to elaborate and introduce your perspective and perception. Also please feel free to consider your response to intense and emotional scenes from the movie.

After watching City of God, then read Chapters 1, 7 and part of the afterword from Geoffrey West's Scale.  Consider his ideas about our exponentially expanding socioeconomic urbanized world, his call for a science of cities and his application of ideas about scaling and non-linear behavior to human development processes.  What is your response to his ideas about human development within the context of complexity and then also data science?
